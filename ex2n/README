this jar file contain-
    MathTerm.java - 
        The base class for the entire class library. It defines the interface
        (the public part of the classes) for all other math terms which will
        extend it.
        
    SimpleMathTerm.java - 
        This class represents a math term (numbers or letters).
    
    BracketsMath.java - 
        This class represents a math term between brackets.
    
    SumMathTerm.java - 
        This class represents a mathematical sum.
    
    BinaryMathTerm.java - 
        This is also subclass of MathTerm and the base class for all the MathTerm
        classes that incorporate exactly two other MathTerms.
    
    SimpleBinaryOpMathTerm.java - 
        This class represents a simple operation between two other terms.
    
    FracMathTerm.java - 
        This class represents a special case of binary math term. It should be
        rendered as a fraction

regarding the Integral i would have used SumMathTerm (and probably change the
name of the class), so i can use first to terms as the edges of the Integral, 
and insted of the term to sum i'll put the function of the Integral.
